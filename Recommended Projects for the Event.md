# Recommended Projects for the Event

The event targets experienced blockchain developers, and an appropriate understanding is required regarding the basic tools and know-how involved in the development of Ethereum DApps.



## Beginner

For beginners who are interested in blockchain development, we recommend the following courses and case studies that will allow you to learn about blockchain development in a short period. Moreover, during the event, they can also be submitted as the delivery. To be more specific, participants can migrate the courses and case studies in the Ethereum network onto the PlatON/Alaya network, verify their availability, and have them modified/adjusted for the network.

## Experienced developer

If you are experienced in the development of Ethereum contracts or Dapps, you can go ahead and connect the relevant Ethereum development tool with the Alaya development network for verification.

We recommend the migration of open-source DApps or base components in the Ethereum ecosystem for verifying the availability and compatibility of all the tools, resources, and documents involved in the entire process of DApp development. During this process, participants are encouraged to find and fix bugs and make adjustments for the PlatON/Alaya network.
