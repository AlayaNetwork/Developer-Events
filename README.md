[[ä¸­æ–‡]](https://github.com/AlayaNetwork/Developer-Events/blob/main/README-CN.md)

As an open source technology community, PlatON has been committed to the construction and support of the developer community.

To encourage and support more community developers to participate in the development and construction of PlatON's infrastructure and ecosystem, the LatticeX Foundation will hold various developer events from time to time with generous rewards. Everyone is welcome to follow and participate in these events.



## Ongoing Events

### [PlatON|Community Verification Event for Alaya Ethereum-Compatible Version  (Phase 1)](https://github.com/AlayaNetwork/Developer-Events/tree/main/Community_Verification_Event(First))

Based on the PlatON and Alaya development network, this developer event for Ethereum ecosystem tool/application migration and verification aims to verify the compatibility, reliability and experience of PlatON and Alaya network for the Ethereum ecosystem tools. We hope to improve the compatibility of Ethereum ecosystem tools through this event, and provide community developers with more abundant and available development tools, tutorials and reference examples.

Event time: **2021/10/19~2021/11/14**

ðŸŽŠ **More developer events for the migration of such applications and tools are on the way, and we welcome your attention and participation.**



### [PlatON Hackathon PLUS! With $1 Million Project Incentives](https://github.com/AlayaNetwork/Developer-Events/blob/main/Hackathon_PLUS/README.md)

"Hackathon PLUS" will provide additional 1-million-dollar project incentives for the first batch of 31 hackathon project teams that participated in the ecosystem construction, as a gesture to encourage further development, research, and launch on PlatON as well as continued contributions to PlatON ecosystem construction and development events to expand PlatON's global presence.
